# Contributions
::: warning
Before doing anything, read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/usc-swug/mechanica/blob/d64e91cea619d0aacdfc6d0ebdbe2f4e9dd5e44e/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
:::

Mechanica is a notes repository built by students for students. As such, it requires contributions by everyone in order to keep course-related information available.
We welcome contributions from everyone to help improve this resource for the community. 

If you want to help out the community, there are two ways to contribute to **Mechanica**. 

## Notes (Google Documents)

This method is used for contribution to the *notes section* of each course.

1. **Find Google Document**: Find the corresponding google document of the course that you want to contribute to. The links can be found [here](../introduction/resources/#Google). Or, you can click on the '*Edit this page.*' button, found on the bottom left of each page.

2. **Request Access**: Once you've opened the relevant Google Document, request access by clicking the **Share** button on the top right corner and clicking on the **Ask to share** button. Afterwards, enter your email on the 'Add people and groups' field and make sure **Editor** is set on the right. Then, click send.

**Alternatively**, you can contact [us](../introduction/about/#Contact) to get **editor** access to the relevant Google Documents. By default you should have commenter permissions.
3. **Suggest Edits**: If you don't have editor access, use the "Suggesting" mode to propose changes to existing text.
4. **Comment**: Leave comments for discussion on specific sections.

## Markdown (GitHub)

This is the standard workflow for changes with the raw markdown files of each page.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone Electronically**: Download the repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/new-mechanism` or `fix/typo`).
4. **Commit Changes**: Provide clear, descriptive commit messages.
5. **Push and PR**: Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.
6. **Code Review**: Participate in the review process and address any feedback provided by us.
