There are two ways to contribute to **Mechanica**. 

## Method 1 (Google Documents)

This method is used for contribution to the notes section of each course.


1. **Request Access**: Contact [us](../introduction/about/#Contact) to get **editor** access to the relevant Google Documents. By default you should have commenter permissions.
2. **Suggest Edits**: If you don't have editor access, use the "Suggesting" mode to propose changes to existing text.
3. **Comment**: Leave comments for discussion on specific sections.

## Method 2 (GitHub)

This is the standard workflow for code changes and technical documentation updates.

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a personal copy of the repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone Electronically**: Download the repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/new-mechanism` or `fix/typo`).
4. **Commit Changes**: Provide clear, descriptive commit messages.
5. **Push and PR**: Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against the `main` branch of the original repository.
6. **Code Review**: Participate in the review process and address any feedback provided by the maintainers.
